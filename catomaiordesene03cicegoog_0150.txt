circle embracing his friend Laelius, L. Furius Philus, Scaevola
(the augur), Fannius, and the poets Lucilius and Terence.
Rumor had it that he assisted Terence in the composition oi
his comedies.

To Laelius, Scipio was attached by ties of the closest friend-
ship. At home and in the field the two were inseparable.
Cicero in the Republic (Ι, 18) tells us that Laelius reverenced
Scipio as divine in consequence oi his military prowess, while
Scipio in turn regarded Laelius as aiather. Their views oi life

- aud government were identical; even the observatione on friend·

ship which Cicero in this dialogue puts in the mouth oi Laelius
are expressly declared by the latter to be those of his friend.
Politically Scipio was a firm aristocrat. He had been ab·

· sent in Spain at the time oi the disturbances which culminated

in the murder oi Tiberius Gracchus, but on his return he spolre
out boldly and, though married tc Sempronia, the sister oi
Gracchus, did not hesitate to declare his belief that the agitator
had been justly elain. This was in 133 ac, and' ior the four
remaining years of his life Scipio was the recognized leader oi
the aristocratic party. One morning in 129 ac. he was found
dead in his bed. Whether he was the victim oi violence or died
a natural death was never known. Suspicion pointed to ioul
play at the hands oi his political opponente. Rumor linked
itself especially with the names oi Fulvius, Carbo, and the
younger Gracchus. Oi these, Carbo was the most generally
suspected, and is even expressly mentioned by Cicero as the
author oi the deed.
