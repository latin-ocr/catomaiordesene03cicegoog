the few Mes. having that reading irorn the te oi line 2, immadi·
ately below. But epo, lf read here, would necessarily be emphatic,
and an emphatic epo is distinctly out of place in this passage. I·
have consequently preferred te, at varianae with nearly all recent
editors lt is not impossible that quid te became quit te, and this
again, by haplography, quit e, which was interpreted as qui (ie.
qaid) epo ; or ego may have been tha arbitrary alteration of some
copyist who failed to see the construction oi te.

17. me ipsum: me etiam ipsam is the reading of L aud is
adopted by Sommerbrodt,h1illler,and most subsequent editors3
but the locution et. . . et etiam is an extremely unusual one.
Merguet, in his Lexikon zu den Phil. Schriften des Clcero, Ι, 13860
b, cites three instaures, hut none of them is at all parallel to the
present passage. The two lustauees of et . . . et etiam occurring
in the Speeches, pro Plancio, 91, and pro Murena, ii, are also
quite different.

2. 6. landari setis digne: the reading of most Mss.; ΒΕ
have digne satie laudari, 3 reading adopted by Sommerbrodt and
Miiller. But in Cicero’s Speeehes and Philosophical Works,
according to Merguet's Iexilra, no instance occurs where satiris
postponed after adiectives or adverbs. Verr. I, 82 we find satia
diyae persequi ,· post red. in Seu. 19 eatis diane loquetur.

ll. cens: this was the Ciceronian orthography. Cius belongs
to the tirne of the Empire. See Georges Lexilron der lat Wort·
forman, s.v. Similarly Cicero wrote Antiochia, Alexandria.

31. potestmalum videri: this is the reading of most Mss.; L
has maium potest videri, followed by Miiller. But this violates
Cicero’s diction: with potest videri a predicate adiective always
stands immediately before cidari.

il. 1. adeptam: the Mas. vary between' adepti and adeptam.
Ι have adopted adeptam aa the imcilior lectio.

9. nulla consolatione: most Mse. read consolatio,· but eoa·
solatione has the support of EI, and is demanded by the sense.

15. discriptae: the Mss. waver between discriptae and descrip-
tae. Reid prefers descriptam in the sense of ‘written out,’ ‘worked
out'3 but actam sabatae describere, so far as Ι am able to discover,
could mean only ‘to transcribe (from 3 copy).‘

20. Quid eat enirn, etc: the favorlte interpretation ol thia pas
